    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This will install
      the <a href="https://iraf-community.github.io">Community
      IRAF</a> core, the X11 graphical tools (xgterm and ximtool), and
      a number of commonly used external packages.
    </p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      The X11 packages need an X server
      (<a href="https://www.xquartz.org/">XQuartz</a>) which must be
      installed separately. To compile own IRAF tasks, the XCode
      command line tools are needed.
    </p>
    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p>
      Please be aware the IRAF is 40 years old legacy code and
      institutional support for IRAF and its usage is going away
      quickly. It is recommended to search alternative solutions, for
      example in the Astropy community, and not to start new projects
      using IRAF.
